## Description
In this app, the user is prompted to enter their names and then given different options on how they can interact with the app. This is done through short codes with different descriptions. Once a user selects the short code of their interest, they are directed to their selections. Among the things that users can do with the app include creating new user profiles, creating new user credentials, saving the details of registered users and credentials, and can view them in a list. Additionally, a user can delete credentials as well as users in the saved user list and credential list.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. You will need Ubuntu terminal to run the commands. 
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder containing the script files. 
3.  When using Python 3.6, type the following command in the terminal:

4. Follow the prompt for the available options.
5. To edit the code, just clone the whole folder and open the files using any text editors
